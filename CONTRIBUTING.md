   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Learning-Platform-Project-for-Open-Source-Hackfest.git
   cd Learning-Platform-Project-for-Open-Source-Hackfest
   ```

3. **Open index.html** in your browser to test the platform

4. **Get your API keys** (for testing):

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

### Before Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Test your changes** - Open the platform in your browser and verify everything works
2. **Check the console** - Open browser DevTools (F12) and ensure no errors appear
3. **Follow the code style** - Keep comments detailed and beginner-friendly
4. **Update documentation** - If you change functionality, update comments/README

### Code Style

This project is designed to be **beginner-friendly**, so:

- ✅ **Add detailed comments** - Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- ✅ **Use clear variable names** - `studentName` not `sn`
- ✅ **Keep it simple** - Avoid complex patterns when simple ones work
- ✅ **Include learning notes** - Help others understand the code

**Example of good commenting:**
```javascript
// Check if user already exists in CONTRIBUTORS.md
// We search for their GitHub username (unique identifier)
// to prevent duplicate entries
if (currentContent.includes(`@${githubUsername}`)) {
    throw new Error('You already completed this course!');
}
```

├── script.js           # Main application logic and event handling
